## Project insights
- I have been following a udemy course, to learn on the Robotic Operating system 2.
- With the level 1 of that course I learnt the following things:
-> How to create topics, publishers and subscribers.
-> How to create ROS2 interfaces, msgs and services.
-> How to use ROS2 communication, using msgs and services.
-> How to create a launch file and launch the project with a single line of code.

- I have also made a final project "Turtle_catch_them_all" which does the following things:
-> Opens turtlesim simulation node, and gets details of the first spawned turtle which name as a "Hero turtle".
-> The main aim of the Hero turtle is to kill the enemy turtles which spawns on the map at even time intervals.
-> I have made 3 python code, to deal with at.
-> The first code takes care of controlling the hero turtle.
-> The second code takes care of spawning the enemy turtles and,
-> the third code takes care of killing the enemy turtles.

- It was such a great experience going through, to set up ubuntu  and ROS2 with the help of this udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/ros2-for-beginners/
